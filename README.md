## Hack submission - BLU

[Gnosis Safe on Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xDcece7aAEF7B2F825Ee749605B59B5E5dcf173CC#code) to hold user savings in order to attain yield in specific assets ($sDAI, $APE, $unsETH)

[NEAR BOS Code](https://bos.gg/#/mob.near/widget/WidgetSource?src=chloe.near/widget/piglet) connecting Polygon backend to NEAR front end.

So much fun stuff to do with The Graph and [substreams](https://github.com/doulos819/ETHWaterloo-piglet/blob/main/piglet-poly-dai-stream.json) as well as [working with flat JSON]() for the first time.
